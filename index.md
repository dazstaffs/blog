## 🌟 Welcome to my Blog!

Hi there! I’m Darren Stafford, a seasoned IT professional with a career spanning over 16 years (since 2007) across diverse industries — from Insurance (since 2018) and Pharmaceuticals, to leadership roles in tech.

My journey started in IT Service Management, evolved through hands-on technical work, and led me to my current role as a Head of Software Engineering in insurance. Along the way, I’ve gathered insights, lessons, and a few war stories—all of which I’m excited to share here.

This blog will cover everything from software engineering best practices and IT leadership to industry-specific tech challenges. Whether you’re a fellow IT pro, a curious learner, or just passing through, I hope you find something valuable (or at least entertaining!).

Thanks for stopping by—let’s dive in.

**– Darren**
