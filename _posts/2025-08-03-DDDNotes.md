DDD Reading or Developer Developer Developer Reading, for many years was my favourite event of the year. Hundreds of Software Engineers would flock to the Microsoft HQ at Reading (on a Saturday as well!) to listen to the best speakers talk on software engineering subjects. It was impossible for a software engineer to not walk away from the event without a renewed sense of curiousity and for me, it was also a time to catch-up with my friends from my days at Stericycle Expert Solutions. Sadly DDD Reading did not survive the COVID shutdown, but other DDD events still live-on across the country each year but hopefully the notes I made can inspire you to attend an event for yourself.

In this article, I'm not going to attempt to summarise years of DDD notes, because, for example, notes from 2017 are no longer relevant in this fast paced tech world, but I will summarise the sessions I think are still relevant.

## DDD Reading 2017 - 10 More Things you need to do to succeed as a Tech Lead

The original 10 points were this:

1. Having Coding Standards
2. Process & Automation
3. Use Personas
4. Use sketches
5. Nuget as much as possible
6. Handle Technical Debt
7. Use MDDs (Mini Design Documents) and POLS (Principle of Least Surprise) Designs
8. Drive Sprint Planning
9. Listen, Appraise, Decide
10. Learn & Share

The 10 more things:

1. Breaks Things Up
   - Break everything into bitesize pieces.
   - BA's think of features, not PBIs (Product Backlog Items) and Epics.
2. Instrumentation:
   - Think about what to capture - timers? latency?
   - This shouldn't be an afterthought, you should start measuring immediately from project start.
   - Counters, gauges, meters, histograms - could be used to display your metrics.
   - SPLUNK will help you visualise this data as well.
   - Server OS counters can help as well.
3. Benchmark Performance:
   - Capture loads times with chrome dev tools
   - Browser performance is important
   - Measure from project start
   - Test loads times from countries like America
   - Test against representative data, 1000 records may perform amazing well but what about 2.8 million?
   - If testing is still successful with 2.8 million records then you've probably chosen the right technologies.
4. Track Your Technical Debt:
   - Can be in a spreadsheet
   - SonarLint/SolarQube/any code quality dashboard
   - Record results
5. Production Readiness -- Ask yourself these key questions, Is your solution:
   - Tested?
   - Usable?
   - Reviewed?
   - Logging?
   - Monitored?
   - Instrumented?
   - Manageable?
   - Versioned?
   - Deployable?
   - Discoverable?
   - Benchmarked?
6. Step away from the shiny new technologies:
   - Is this new technology fit for purpose?
   - Is it efficient?
   - New tools = new problems.
   - Prototype & evaluate new technologies first.
   - .NET core is loved by many developers but has its flaws.
7. Security
   - Knowledge out there is poor so you must educate your teams.
   - Google top 10 breaches of security and you'll see that over the top 10 breaches over 37 millions records have been leaked.
   - Breaches can be a PR disaster; 24x7 media can bring a company to its knees.
   - Build a security culture.
   - Where is your data stored exactly; what are your attack vectors?
   - Are you complying with Compliance Regulations?
   - Never write your own security code. Cryptography and Authentication algorithms should be left to the mathematicians, Azure AD and 2FF experts.
   - One Penetration test before deployment is never enough.
8. Clean Code Sessions
   - A meeting with developers to discuss problems and approaches with no Project Management influence will deliver great results.
   - Unconference style with no agenda.
   - Not just a moan session.
   - Put issues on a whiteboard.
   - Tech Lead should bring issues in-case no one has any to start the session off.
   - Everyone contributes!
   - Invite guests.
   - Show'n'Tell in every session.
9. It's all about money
   - Cost per feature
   - Hardware & Software costs.
   - Developers costs
   - Prototype costs
   - Azure costs
10. KISSALAP (Keep It Simple As Long As Possible)
    - Balance YAGNI vs Product Capability
    - Delaying Complexity vs Technical Debt
    - Rework a prototype vs build from scratch.

## DDD Reading 2018 - How Microsoft Does DevOps

- Release a BETA version, take customer feedback, improve the software and release it, is the Microsoft(MS) ethos.
- Stable, self-managing, cross purpose teams is key.
- Team stability was very important. No team changes for 12 months was the goal so MS did a stickynote exercise to create self-forming teams:
  - Managers were scared of losing all their staff to other teams so Managers started to market themselves to MS employees.
  - Each person had 3 postitis for 1st, 2nd and 3rd team choices. On a whiteboard the postits were placed under different teams.
  - Only 20% of people actually wanted to change teams.
  - Only 1 person was forced to a team that wasn't their choice. 90% got their first choice.
- Daniel H Pink's book -- DriVE was key in the decision to change all the teams.
- Teams work in Scrum, KANBAN or however they want as long as they deliver value.
- Fixed 3 week sprints. All sprints across the teams are aligned so all teams end their 3 weeks on the same day.
- Bug cap of 5 per Engineer. If your team has 10 engineers x 5 bugs that means a max of 50 bugs before dev work must stop to fix the bugs and therefore less features in the next sprint.
- No admin wasted on timesheets unless the team really wants them.
- There was an alignment project to ensure all teams used git, etc.
- How to sync your teams?
  - Sprint Mail
    - What was achieved this sprint?
    - Video Demo (Max 5 mins) because competitive teams meant all kinds of fancy video editing which meant long videos.
    - What value was delivered?
    - What's in the next sprint?
  - Quarterly leadership meetings
    - Next 3 sprints?
    - Is the team healthy?
    - Risks or issues to highlight?
  - Experience Reviews
    - Are storyboards consistent with code?
    - High level execution plans. Not in Microsoft Project - "even Microsoft don't use Microsoft Project" ðŸ¤£
    - "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything"
  - Planning Strategy Document
    - 6 pages max
    - This sprint = Team Responsibility
    - Next 3 sprints = Team Responsibility
    - Next Season (6 months) = Team + Leadership Responsibility
    - Next Year (12 months) = Leadership Responsibility
- Team plans change especially when GDPR came along.
- Use git for a repo
  - Everyone works from Master Branch.
  - Engineers don't merge what they didn't write.
  - You broke it, you fix it!
  - Pull requests are validated to ensure they'll run.
  - Checks run to ensure no passwords were changed that will break master.
  - All tests must pass before a new version is deployed to master to ensure previously written functionality been broken.
- Quality ownership role works on a rotation. All roles in the team work on a rotation. Roles include:
  - Program Management
  - Development (UI, Frontend, Backend, etc)
- All developers had to write tests, some didn't want to but they had to change or leave.
- Quality is important -- no one wants to be called in the middle of the night by an automated system until a problem is fixed which actually happens at Microsoft.
- Tests were taking too long, over 24 hours to run them all and tests failed frequently.
- Tests were written over time and not just overnight for legacy systems.
- Takes 2 weeks to deliver new features to all data centres across the world. MS uses a phased approach which has pros and cons.
- Monthly Service reports created by a different person in each team every month to action alerts and do uptime reporting.
- Security Mindsets
  - Red vs Blue teams
  - Blind Tests
  - Full disclosure after pen tests are completed. Teams share tactics and lessons learned after the tests are complete. This only happens internally.
  - "Free iPhone" phising email was sent around MS. Too many people replied.
- After the big changes at Microsoft:

  - Zero tech debt
  - Flattened org chart
  - Features every sprint
  - Team Rooms
  - Customer Engagement
  - Public Shared Roadmap
  - Everyone working in master branch
  - Test or Leave Ethos
  - General Approach:

## DDD South West 2024 - Domain Driven Design -- Bridging Business & Tech at Lufthansa

- Ubiquitous language -- BAs and Developers need a common language.
- Bounded Context -- Operational changes model
- Aggregates -- Cluster of related objects (entities & values). Treated as a single unit.
- Repos -- Search for persistent stores or databases.
- Domain experts bridge the gaps:
  - Devs work closely with Domain experts.
- Deep understanding of domain and key concepts.
  - Model Business Design in system
  - Domain models created
  - Takes 3 years to mature
- Do not use abbreviations in DDD (Domain Driven Design)
- Each domain has a microservice
- In code, classes such as "check-in" and "luggage", are linked to domain information in DocSpace.
- Lufthansa/Google Operations Decision Support Suite(OPSD) at a high level look like this:

- Challenges
  - If app isn't complex, you don't need DDD.
  - Not favorable for data centric systems but you can use service bus queueing to solve data centric problems.
- DDD abstraction is a mindset change

## DDD South West 2024 - Open AI vs Azure AI

- ChatGPT is OpenAI which was established in 2015 by Elon Musk
- Microsoft owns 49% of OpenAI
- OpenAI examples:
  - Chat GPT
  - Dall-E
  - Whisper
  - TTS
  - Embeddings
- AWS & Anthiopic are working together
- GCP & Gemini using Google Depp Mind
- Playground in Open AI & Azure
- Azure are doing "deploy to webapp" and Azure have added more functionality
- OpenAI has free mode but Azure does not. Azure 100 tokens is 75 words
- Open AI needs a lot of storage for:
  - Vector DB
  - Data for embedding
  - Convo history
  - Prompt Engineering
  - Ethical AI
  - App web/mobile
- Azure:
  - Training data only trains customer model
  - Have SLAs but Open AI does not work to SLAs
- You can jailbreak OpenAI.
- Air Canada blamed chatbot for their chatbot refund advice which landed them in court where they lost.
- DevOps has magic 8 step flow:

- Dashboards stored in [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
- Learning Resources:
  - MS Learn
  - OpenAI Cookbook
- Azure AI is built on top of the OpenAI offering, with more tools. That's their business model. Same product with other tools built on-top.
