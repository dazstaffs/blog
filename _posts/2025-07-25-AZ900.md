If you're starting your journey into cloud computing or Microsoft Azure, the AZ-900 exam is a fantastic entry point. I recently cleared this exam and wanted to share the most important concepts and takeaways to help you prepare effectively.

## What is AZ-900?

The Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) exam validates your foundational knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services, security, compliance, pricing, and support. Itâ€™s designed for both technical and non-technical professionals.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Understand Core Cloud Concepts**

- **Cloud Computing Models**:

  - **Public Cloud** (Azure, AWS, GCP) â€“ Services owned by third-party providers.
  - **Private Cloud** â€“ Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
  - **Hybrid Cloud** â€“ Combines public and private clouds for flexibility.

- **Cloud Service Models**:

  - **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) â€“ Rent virtualized hardware (e.g., Azure VMs).
  - **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) â€“ Develop apps without managing infrastructure (e.g., Azure App Service).
  - **SaaS** (Software as a Service) â€“ Ready-to-use software (e.g., Microsoft 365).

### 2. **Azure Core Services**

- **Compute**: Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions (Serverless).
- **Networking**: Virtual Network (VNet), Load Balancer, Azure DNS.
- **Storage**: Blob Storage (unstructured data), Disk Storage (VMs), Azure Files (file shares).
- **Databases**: Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB (NoSQL).

### 3. **Security & Compliance**

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Microsoft secures the cloud infrastructure; you secure your data and access.
- **Azure Security Tools**:
  - **Azure Security Center** â€“ Unified security management.
  - **Azure Active Directory (AD)** â€“ Identity and access management.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** â€“ Extra login security.
- **Compliance Standards**: GDPR, HIPAA, ISO â€“ Azure meets major regulatory requirements.

### 4. **Pricing & Cost Management**

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Free Tier & Credits**: Many services offer free tiers (e.g., 12 months free for select services).
- **Cost-Saving Options**:
  - **Reserved Instances** â€“ Discount for long-term commitments.
  - **Spot VMs** â€“ Cheap but can be interrupted.
- **Azure Pricing Calculator**: Estimate costs before deployment.

### 5. **Support & SLAs**

- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Guarantees uptime (e.g., 99.9% for VMs).
- **Azure Support Plans**:
  - **Basic** (Free) â€“ Limited to documentation/community.
  - **Developer/Standard/Professional Direct** â€“ Paid tiers with faster response times.
