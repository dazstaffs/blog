If you're starting your journey into cloud computing or Microsoft Azure, the AZ-900 exam is a fantastic entry point. I recently passed this exam and wanted to share the most important concepts and takeaways to help you prepare effectively.

## What is AZ-900?

The Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) exam validates your foundational knowledge of cloud concepts, Azure services, security, compliance, pricing, and support. It’s designed for both technical and non-technical professionals.

## Key Takeaways

### 1. **Understand Core Cloud Concepts**

- **Cloud Computing Models**:

  - **Public Cloud** (Azure, AWS, GCP) – Services owned by third-party providers.
  - **Private Cloud** – Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization.
  - **Hybrid Cloud** – Combines public and private clouds for flexibility.

- **Cloud Service Models**:

  - **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service) – Rent virtualized hardware (e.g., Azure VMs).
  - **PaaS** (Platform as a Service) – Develop apps without managing infrastructure (e.g., Azure App Service).
  - **SaaS** (Software as a Service) – Ready-to-use software (e.g., Microsoft 365).

### 2. **Azure Core Services**

- **Compute**: Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions (Serverless).
- **Networking**: Virtual Network (VNet), Load Balancer, Azure DNS.
- **Storage**: Blob Storage (unstructured data), Disk Storage (VMs), Azure Files (file shares).
- **Databases**: Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB (NoSQL).

### 3. **Security & Compliance**

- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Microsoft secures the cloud infrastructure; you secure your data and access.
- **Azure Security Tools**:
  - **Azure Security Center** – Unified security management.
  - **Azure Active Directory (AD)** – Identity and access management.
  - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** – Extra login security.
  - **Microsoft Purview** - A unified data governance service working across on-prem, multicloud and SaaS environments.
- **Compliance Standards**: GDPR, HIPAA, ISO – Azure meets major regulatory requirements.

### 4. **Pricing & Cost Management**

- **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for what you use.
- **Free Tier & Credits**: Many services offer free tiers (e.g., 12 months free for select services).
- **Cost-Saving Options**:
  - **Reserved Instances** – Discount for long-term commitments.
  - **Spot VMs** – Cheap but can be interrupted.
- **Azure Pricing Calculator**: Estimate costs before deployment.
- **Architectural Choices**:
  - **Storage Tiers** - Knowing the difference between hot, cool, cold and archive storage will save money.
  - **Storage Redundancy Zones** - Selecting the correct storage redundancy, i.e. LRS (Locally Redundant Storage), ZRS (Zone-redundant storage), etc.
  - **Azure Cost Advisor** - Azure's customised recommendations for how your company could save money by lowering a virtual machine's sku (stock keeping unit), for example.

### 5. **Support & SLAs**

- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs)**: Guarantees uptime (e.g., 99.9% for VMs).
- **Azure Support Plans**:
  - **Basic** (Free) – Limited to documentation/community.
  - **Developer/Standard/Professional Direct** – Paid tiers with faster response times.

3. **Take Practice Tests**: Sites like Whizlabs or Udemy offer good mock exams.
4. **Know the Exam Breakdown**:
   - Cloud Concepts (20-25%)
   - Azure Services (35-40%)
   - Security & Compliance (20-25%)
   - Pricing & Support (15-20%)

## Final Thoughts

AZ-900 is a beginner-friendly exam that builds a solid foundation for Azure certifications. Whether you're a developer, admin, or business user, these concepts will help you navigate cloud solutions confidently.

Good luck with your exam!
