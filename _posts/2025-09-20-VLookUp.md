Back in 2012, I had to spend two hours every month manually doing cost-centre cross-charging for a previous employer. Very quickly I had to become an Excel master doing VLOOKUPs and other formulas for my manager. There are a few nuances to getting a VLOOKUP working. Here is a how to guide.

## What is a VLOOKUP?

A VLOOKUP is an Excel spreadsheet function that searches for a specified value in the first column of a table and returns a corresponding value from a different column on another row. That row, in the example I go through, will be on a different sheet, and here is a visual representation of an example where I want to look up the top speed of an animal from another sheet.

## 1. Indexes

Firstly, you want column A to be your lookup index on both sheets. If your index is not in Column A, your lookup won’t work. Note in this example how the Animals are in Column A on both sheets.

## 2. Start VLOOKUP

Add VLOOKUP by pressing fx and searching for VLOOKUP or by typing =VLOOKUP(). For 'Lookup_value', you want the exact cell you are looking up, such as A2 in this example. Note how Excel has added "Dog", so we know what we are looking up exactly.

## 3. Select your Table-array

Next you want to select your table array. I haven't selected my column headers for this but I have selected the whole dataset on the "Top Speed" dataset.

## 4. Select Range-lookup

For the range lookup, type either TRUE or FALSE. I always choose FALSE because I want an exact match. If you want the first match, choose TRUE.

## 5. Apply Formula to Other Rows

You can now apply your formula to other rows and you have the data you want in the column you want to see it. However, there is one problem with this - your range-lookup is incrementing on each row and it has potential to affect your lookup. Note how the range is now A4:B6 when it should be A2:A4; your lookup range is not changing, but Excel is trying to be clever...

## 6. Add the dollar sign around your column letters

To stop Excel from being clever, you need to stop it from incrementing your ranges by putting the dollar sign around your column letters. Now push your formula down the rows and it won’t update the ranges and break your VLOOKUP:

## Final Thoughts

This is just a quick tutorial on VLOOKUP. I have made a few assumptions regarding your ability to use Excel, but I hope you find this article useful.
