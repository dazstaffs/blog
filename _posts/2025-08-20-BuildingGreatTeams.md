Building a great team, is by far the greatest achievement of my career to date. I'm sure some ex-colleagues would argue that the work I did on Harley Davidson's Lead Management System, was pretty special because of the user experience and follow-on sales off of the back of that work, but building a great team is what I'm most proud of. If you're a new leader, looking for some advice, I'm certainly whiling to share my approach, but it is key to note that every leader's experience is different and while some of the advice below worked for me, it may not work for you, but why not experiment with my advice to see what works for your situation.

## Books

Although somewhat naive on reflection, I started reading books about leadership a few years before actually becoming a leader, as preparation. I would definitely recommend the following books:

- Becoming an Effective Software Engineering Manager, James Stanier - this the perfect read for a new leader in software engineering. Some of the key takeaways include how to conduct 121s with your team in a way that they will appreciate, how to market your achievements, how to communicate with your manager and how to hit the ground running.
- The Essential Managers Handbook, Dorling Kindersley - this book is good for understanding performance improvement plans, SMART objectives, how to create a scoring matrix to make a difficult decision and valuing diversity and many other useful things.
- Coaching Skills for Leader in the Workplace, Jackie Arnold - this book explains the GROW (Goals, Reality, Options and What Next) model which is the best coaching model in my opinion and will come in handy in 121s with your team.
- Mastering the Rockefeller Habits, Verne Harnish - this book has a great section on cultural values and how to instil them into your team.

While books alone will not teach you everything you need to know, they will certainly provide you with a basic toolkit to get started.

## Hiring

I'm unable to disclose all of my hiring advice here, because one of my hires later confessed that they read a post I had written and knew about my technical test beforehand, but I can provide some high-level guidelines:

- Always give candidates a technical test that you know cannot be completed within one hour, because we're evaluating the applicant's approach and attitude towards the test. One of my hires once remarked that he was chuffed to join my team, because he thought he had failed the technical test. I later had to explain that I was looking for x, y and z and he ticked all of the boxes.
- Always try to hire someone that you think is better than you; we're trying to build a great team that will take our businesses in new directions than maintain the status quo.
- Hire someone with a good attitude to life and work. I always say I can teach someone insurance but I can't teach them to have the right attitude.
- Look for someone that does not constantly hop companies. I favour someone that spends, on average, at least 3 years with most companies they've worked for.
- Look for someone that shows they invest in their career with extra certifications.

## Harmony

Now that you have some great advice on hiring great people, you will need to create harmony within your team and ensure everyone is working well together. My advice on achieving this is this:

- Setup a rota for arranging socials where 2 people within your team, who wouldn't usually work together, have to come together to arrange a social within a certain budget per head. This not only brings together 2 people for a common cause, but it also creates a social where the whole team can come together to harmonise. Bonus tip - setup a socials scoring system so all team members can compete for the best social for the year.
- Ask your team members to always turn their cameras on for meetings. I have found this works wonders for building harmony and engagement.
- Rotate the scrum master role within each team which not only demonstrates a knowledge of the product by the scrum master but helps team members build confidence in public speaking.
- Bring the team together once a week to discuss work, do demos and discuss life as well. In my team we have a barometer where each individual scores last week on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 is great and 4 is bad. We also have a world day theme, so if it's national fajita day for example, we will discuss it. It's also advisable, if possible, to do this meeting in the office in a meeting room at the same time every week.
- If you have many small teams, look to rotate the team members from time to time which not only creates new synergies but also ensures product knowledge is shared.

This isn't an exhaustive list, but you should find that the above builds better relationships within the workplace.

## Cultural Values

Cultural values should be at the heart of your organisation... and if your organisation hasn't established its values, I would strongly suggest defining your own values. At MS Amlin we have the TIPIC values - Team Work, Innovation, Professionalism, Integrity and Customer Focus and I firmly believe I can relate all issues back to these values and if I need to make a decision, I will use the values to make that decision. If you are having problems instilling your values into your team, I would recommend using the values for the following:

- 121s
- Year End Reviews
- Staff Handbook headings
- Retrospective conversation starters
- Posters around your office
- Desktop background and login images

## Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is fundamental in any team. Within my team we hold quarterly retrospectives, as an entire team, to improve software engineering on top of the usual sprint retrospectives. My team use an Azure DevOps add-in called Retrospectives for this session, to record start, stop and continue items, to vote on the issues we feel strongly about and to time the conversations so we don't talk for more than 5 minutes on any one topic. I chose once a quarter retro because it allows for plenty of time to take action - you don't want the team to bring the same issues to a session every week or month to never see any change, because this will lead the team to see no value in the sessions.

Finally, I think that there's something to be said about collecting plenty of data to show the areas where the team can improve and to discuss the data in your weekly check-in meeting discussed above. I collect a lot of data within my team on sprint burndowns, the size of the backlog, office attendance, team feelings, application usage data, ServiceNow ticket resolution times, cycle time..... basically, every piece of data I can get my hands on and the team slowly improve on the data you put in-front of them.

## Continuous Learning

Finally let's talk about continuous learning and I mean for you! As managers we are never the finished article, there's always something new to learn to improve upon how we lead a team:

- Find a mentor - If your workplace has a mentoring scheme, join it and if it doesn't, start a scheme.
- Find a coach - Similarly relates to finding a mentor, except a mentor is more within your field of work and a coach gives advice at a higher level.
- Book training courses - Always be looking for training courses that improve your leadership skills. I'm currently looking at CMI Level 5 which is recognised training for middle managers.
- Google top books to read - I've mentioned some of my favourite books but it's key to constantly check for new reads.

As my carpentry teacher explained, "after 30 years in the carpentry business, I'm still learning new techniques from my students" and what I interpret from this, is never accept that you've peaked as a manager and cannot improve on how to lead your team.

## Final Thoughts

I have given you a lot of content here to digest as a manager. I hope you have taken something away from this advice and I would recommend that if you are a new manager, you write a three-month plan and incorporate some of the above into that plan. If you're struggling on where to begin with this advice, start with cultural values, move on to building a harmonious team and continuously be looking to improve yourself and your team.

Building a great team can be a long, multi-year journey. It takes patience and more often than not, an evolving strategy that changes from day to day, but eventually you will be walking through your staff canteen watching the two most unlikely people watching Wimbledon tennis together and you will smile, because you know the effort you put in, to build a great team.

Thanks for reading!
