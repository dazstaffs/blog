Lloyd's Lab Accelerator Programme is a fantastic initiative from Lloyds. Twice a year, since 2018, hundreds of companies from all over the world, submit proposals to the Lloyd's Lab team, hoping to be one of circa 20 companies to pitch their idea on pitch day and be ultimately chosen as one of ten companies to join the Accelerator programme.

The Accelerator programme yields many benefits to the chosen. Firstly, they are able to use the Lloyd's building as a base for 10 weeks, they have better access to the market, they get assigned 8 to 12 mentors and the numbers from Lloyd's are there for all to see; A success rate, at time of writing, of 97%, 85% are still working with the Lloyd's market and over 1000 jobs have been created by Lloyd's Lab Alumni.

This was my first time attending pitch day and I walked away with many insights, thoughts and updates on the market. I would recommend all insurance technologists attend this event at least once, if given the opportunity. In this post I will present my takeaways as an insurance technologist and first-time attendee.

## The Big Themes in Cohort 15

For the companies pitching for Cohort 15, Lloyd's stated 3 themes, before proposals were submitted:

- Adapting to a change world - Tackling emerging risks like technology disruption and climate change.
- Traditional lines for today - Modernising legacy products across marine, property, casualty, speciality lines to meet evolving customer needs.
- Data intelligence & process transformation - Enhancing Lloyd's market through advanced analytics, AI powered models, and streamlined market operation.

Every proposal we saw fitted within one of these three themes, Albeit more proposals for the final theme and little for traditional lines, but still within these themes. My perspective on the main themes was:

- Excel - Too many companies are citing Excel as being the number one problem across the board in insurance and I agree. Excel brings many issues such as inconsistent processes, inconsistent data that is never cleansed, tampering issues which unsettles auditors, no real-time analytics, data sprawl in that these Excel spreadsheets can live on a person's computer, in multiple locations on shared drives, etc. Many pitches proposed fixing this issue using AI.
- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) - Every company pitch incorporates AI/ML to some degree. AI/ML is NOT a passing fad, it's here to stay because it REALLY is a game changer. Some common use cases are using it to handle large amounts of Excel spreadsheets and other data to produce some kind of report or insights, some companies are using it to flag certain words/terms (using Large Language Models) as being suspect or adding value and some are just adding agents to their tools to make admin processes more efficient.
- Internet of Things (IOT) Devices - IOT devices capturing data such as wind strength across the year, combined with large pool of historic data, could yield returns down the line. While it's difficult to ever predict when a catastrophic event will actually occur, IOT devices are being seen more and more in insurance. We're also seeing IOT devices being used with parametric insurance terms to automate the payment of claims and monitor, for example the temperature inside a cargo container that could damage a product above or below a certain threshold. IOT devices were already here, but combined with insurance makes for some exciting times.

## My Favourite Pitches

There were so many good pitches yesterday that it's hard to narrow the pitches down to 3 or 4 that stood out for me. Also worth noting that although I see the value with my Software Engineering and MS Amlin hat on, that doesn't mean other solutions wouldn't be more suitable to other businesses problems.

- SanctionsIQ - A Lloyd's market-native solution designed to tackle complex Marine Cargo, SanctionsIQ was pitched as a solution to help struggling compliance teams by searching for legislation and sanctions that affects a shipment using LLMs against written policies. Some tough questions were posed around LLM hallucinations, whereby AI makes up sanctions that do not actually exist, but my thoughts are that as long as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is used and outputs are verified by humans, this problem can be mitigated.
- Sustema BASE platform - Sustema's BASE platform, is a platform using AI-powered tools for matching entity CO2 emissions with the regulatory needs of CP10/25. GHG emissions from customers form 77% of all Global Warming. By using BASE, insurers can get estimations on customer CO2 emissions and this shows consideration towards being CP10/25 compliant.
- KorrAI Technologies TRAIL platform - Combining satellite imagery and document intelligence, this platform assesses land stability, site history and environmental risks, streamlining underwriting and reducing manual investigations. What impressed me about this pitch was the claim that satellite imagery could be turned around in 10 days over the current timeframe of many weeks.
- Hexa - This AI native platform unites processes, risk and data across functions so operational changes flow seamlessly through Claims, Finance and Reporting, increasing resilience and agility while preventing costly compliance failures. What I liked about Hexa is the claim it can help document processes and also build out processes using AI.

## Emerging Risks

Two new risks were brought to everyone's attention yesterday. The first was PFAS or Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which is a group of man-made chemicals known as "forever chemicals" due to their extreme persistence in the environment and the human body, as they don't break down easily. These chemicals have been widely used since the 1950s in products like non-stick cookware, waterproof clothing, and food packaging for their grease- and water-repellent properties. However, exposure to certain PFAS is linked to serious health effects, including immune system disorders, high cholesterol, and certain cancers. Due to environmental and health concerns, efforts are underway to reduce the production and use of PFAS and to address existing contamination in water and soil. While I did not believe the product pitched by 'Ashes to Gold' yesterday was a good insurance product, I did see how PFAS could "be the next asbestos" and thus could require some investment from insurance companies in the future.

The second was the already mentioned CP10/25 regulations potentially coming into force in 2026, which while not being a risk or peril, is a hazard and something that insurers will need to invest in for the future. Climate change cannot be swept under the rug and I do think that as insurers we have a responsibility to build a sustainable planet and if CP10/25 regulations are tied to premium costs, will have a positive impact on all businesses, because who wants to pay higher premiums...

## My First Lloyd's Lab Experience

So, as I wrap things up for another blog post, let's cover the scenario where you haven't been to a Lloyd's Lab Accelerator Pitch Day before and want some advice on what to expect:

- Networking - there will be plenty of opportunities to network, so take some business cards if you have some.
- Insurance Knowledge - it would be advantageous to have passed the LM1 exam, as I have, before attending. Many terms will be thrown around such as wholesale broker, peril, hazard, D&O, E&S, and if you're more technology than insurance, you will be entering with a disadvantage, but don't let that put you off.
- America and Canada - You will hear a lot of America and Canadian accents and pitches aimed at these markets. Most Lloyd's business comes from the USA. This is why you will hear an English presenter mention OFAC, prices in dollars, Donald Trump and the like.
- Music - the same music will be played during the breaks and there's many breaks! It's an annoying tune so either bring ear plugs or take a walk.
- Long Day - If you attend every session and I recommend that you do, it will be a long day, especially if the tube is on-strike as it was for me.
- You don't need a pen and paper - You will be given a pen and a small book from Lloyds outlining everything from presenters, to the process, and there will be plenty of blank pages at the back of the book.
- Tea and coffee are provided and water too. If you stay for the networking session in the evening, I saw beer and wine on-offer as well.
- 11 is 11.15 - The website may say 11 start, but it's really 11.15. The first 15 mins is for networking.
- ID and bag check - You will need a photo ID and you will have your bag checked.
- Train strikes but still a large crowd - I thought it would be an empty room because of the tube strikes but nothing could be further from the truth. It was packed and that is testament to the importance of this event.
- Ask questions - Please ask questions if you attend. It was obvious some presenters didn't understand insurance when certain insurance terms were used, but please do ask some questions, because there are many things that wouldn't have been covered in a 5-minute pitch and the answers will help others score the pitch which helps Lloyds choose who to put through.

## Final Thoughts

Lloyd's Lab Accelerator has been a fantastic initiative from Lloyds since 2018. Attending has helped me understand a lot about insurance trends towards Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things but also new risks such as PFAS and the new potential climate regulations. I now eagerly await news of who is entering the 10 week programme and if I'm not made redundant in 10 weekâ€™s time (although it's likely I will be), I hope to be at demo day to see the end products.

Thanks for reading!
