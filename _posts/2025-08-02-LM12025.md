When it comes to **London Market Essentials 1 (LM1)**, a range of thoughts and emotions come to mind. Firstly, I took the exam and experienced frustration due to at least six technical problems during the remote exam. Despite answering 21 out of 24 questions correctly, I was booted out due to a technical issue and vowed never to retake the exam remotely. On the other hand, studying for LM1 revealed insights I wish I’d gained earlier in my insurance career. The knowledge sparked new questions about the intersection of software engineering and insurance, as well as the future of insurance with AI and Blueprint II.

In this article, I’ll share key takeaways from the LM1 study text and offer tips for taking the exam.

## Study Material Key Takeaways

### Chapter 1 - Fundamental Principles of Insurance

- Insurance is a **risk transfer mechanism**.
- People are either **risk-seeking** or **risk-averse**.
- Risk management is defined as _"The identification, analysis, and economic control of risks that threaten assets or earning capacity."_
- Risk is assessed in terms of **frequency** (how often) and **severity** (how severe).
- A **peril** causes a loss (e.g., fire or flood), while a **hazard** influences the peril’s impact.
  - **Physical hazard**: Measurable risk characteristics (e.g., building construction).
  - **Moral hazard**: Behavioral risks (e.g., dishonesty or carelessness).
- **Insurable risks** must be:
  - Financial (measurable in monetary terms).
  - Pure (potential for loss, not gain).
  - Particular (localized, not widespread).
- **Non-insurable risks** include:
  - Non-financial (e.g., sentimental value).
  - Speculative (e.g., gambling).
  - Fundamental (large-scale risks like war).
- **Insurable interest** is a legal requirement for valid insurance contracts.
- **Compulsory insurances** (by law) include:
  - Employers’ liability.
  - Motor insurance.
  - Public liability.
  - Professional indemnity.

### Chapter 2 - Basic Insurance Legal Principles and Terminology

- A valid contract requires **offer**, **acceptance**, and **consideration**.
- All parties must act in **good faith** (utmost honesty).
- **Disclosure rules**:
  - Insureds need not disclose what insurers "ought to know" or what is "common knowledge."
- **Cancellation**:
  - Insurers can cancel policies by notifying the insured’s last known address.
- **Proximate cause**:
  - The dominant cause of loss with a direct link to the outcome.
- **Peril categories**:
  - Insured (covered).
  - Excepted/excluded (specifically not covered).
  - Uninsured/unnamed (not mentioned in the policy).
- **Indemnity**:
  - _"Financial compensation to restore the insured to their pre-loss financial position."_
  - Settlement methods: cash, repairs, reinstatement, or replacement.
- **Financial adjustments**:
  - **Excess**: Deductible paid by the insured per claim.
  - **Deductible**: Larger, often voluntary, self-insured amount.
  - **Franchise**: Threshold where the insurer pays the full claim if exceeded.
- **Contribution**:
  - When multiple insurers cover the same risk, they share the claim proportionally (by sum insured or independent liability).
- **Subrogation**:
  - Insurer’s right to recover costs from a third party after paying a claim.

### Chapter 3 - Main Classes of Business in the London Market

- **Marine**:
  - Covers cargo, hulls, and liabilities.
  - **Particular average**: Physical damage (unique to marine).
  - **Loss of earnings**: Equivalent to business interruption in other classes.

  - **Business interruption**: Covers lost income due to disruptions.
- **Aviation**:
  - Physical damage, liability, loss of license (pilots), and loss of use (aircraft).

  - Transfers risk from insurers to other insurers.
  - Benefits: Capacity expansion, risk smoothing, and portfolio protection.

### Chapter 4 - The Insurance Cycle

- **Supply and demand tools**:

  - **Low-order**: Local influence (e.g., everyday items).
- **Elasticity**: Demand sensitivity to price changes.
- **Equilibrium**: Balanced supply and demand.
- **Cycle phases**:
  1. New insurers enter → capacity increases → prices drop.
  2. Losses occur → insurers exit → supply shrinks → prices rise.
  3. Repeat.

## Exam Tips

1. **Avoid remote proctoring** if possible. PSI’s remote invigilation service is unreliable, and technical issues may delay resolutions for weeks.
2. **Read the study text 4+ times**. It’s dense, but memorization is key. Highlight and take notes.
3. **Use RevisionMate**. Practice tests reveal gaps in knowledge.
4. **Retake fees are steep** (£150+ at time of writing).
5. **In-person exams** minimize technical risks.

## Final Thoughts

The LM1 study guide is comprehensive but not exhaustive for the exam. This summary distills the essentials, though thorough text review is advised. If you must take the exam, opt for in-person testing to avoid PSI’s pitfalls.
