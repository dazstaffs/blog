When it comes to London Market Essentials 1(LM1), a range of thoughts and emotions go through my mind, firstly because I took the exam and due to at least 6 technical problems, I was frustrated by the remote exam experience and vowed to never take the exam again, despite landing 21 in 24 correct answers before being booted out with a technical issue, but on the other hand I have found studying for this exam to be something that I wish I had done at the start of my insurance career, because the knowledge I have gained has led to many new questions about how software engineering and insurance fit together and where insurance is heading with AI and Blueprint II.

In this article I am going to share everything I found valuable from the LM1 study text and why I do now believe, that as a software engineer in insuramce, studying for LM1 is essential. I'll also add tips for taking the exam and everything that went wrong during my exam experience.

## Study Material Key Takeaways

### Chapter 1 - Fundamental principles of insurance

- Insurance is a risk transfer mechanism
- People are either classed as "risk seeking" or "risk adverse"
- Risk management may be defined as "The identification, analysis and economic control of those risks which can threaten the assets or earning capacity of an enterprise.
- Risk is usually assessed in terms of frequency and severity.
- A peril can be defined as that which gives rise to a loss, i.e fire or flood and a hazard is defined as that which influences the operation or effect of the peril.
- A hazard can be broken down into a physical hazard, i.e the physical characteristics of the risk and includes any measurable dimension of the risk or a moral hazard which arises from the attitude and behaviour of people.
- Not all risks are insurable. An insurable risk will be financial (measurable in financial terms), pure (possibility of a loss but not a gain) or particular (localised) and a non-insurable risk will be non-financial(sentimental value), speculative(gambling) or fundamental (large scale risk)
- Insurable interest is a legal requirement for an insurance contract to be valid.
- Some types of insurance are compulsory by law such as employers' liability, motor insurance, public liability and professional indemnity insurances.

### Chapter 2 - Basic insurance legal principles and terminology

- For a contract to be valid, there must be an offer, acceptance and consideration.
- All parties to a contract must act in good faith.
- Not all information has to be disclosed under contract law. Things that an insurer ought to know or are presumed to know, do not need to be disclosed.
- Most general insurance policies have a cancellation condition which can be activated providing a letter is sent to the last know address of the consumer.
- Proximate cause is defined as the dominant cause and there is a direct link between it and the resulting loss.
- Perils can be insured, excepted/excluded or uninsured/unnamed.
- Indemnity can be defined as "finanicial compensation sufficient to place the insured in the same financial position after a loss as they enjoyed immediately before the loss occured."
- Settlements can be cash, repairs, reinstatements or replacements
- There's a distinction between an excess, deductible and a franchise.
- Contribution occurs when more than one insurer covers a risk in separate policies. Insurers will contribute to a claim on the basis of a rateable proportion which can be by sum insured or by independent liability.
- Subrogation is the right of an insurer following payment of a claim, to take over the insured's right to recover payment from a third party responsible for the loss.

### Chapter 3 - Main classes of business written in the London Market

- Main classes are marine, non-marine, aviation and reinsurance
- In marine, the term "particular average" refers to physical damage. But in other classes of insurance, it refers to something else.
- In marine, loss of earnings insurance, covers where a shipowner cannot earn money from their ship. In non-marine this is called business interuption insurance and in aviation this is called loss of use insurance and this distinction must be recognised for the exam.
- Marine covers many types of insurance such as loss of earnings, cargo, goods in transit, stock throughput, jeweller's block, specie(loose gemstones, precious metals, valuable documents, etc.), fine art, satelitte, cash in transit, goods in transit, war and strikes, marine liabilities, political risks and offshore energy insurances.
- Non-marine insurance includes property, stock, theft, glass, goods in transit, pecuniary (money and fidelity guarantee insurance), construction, onshore energy, cyber, business interuption, contiguent business interuption, advanced loss of profits, delay in start-up, non-marine liabilities (casualty), bloodstock (racehorses), livestock (other animals), continency (event cancellation, weather-related, prize indemnity, death and disgrace and over-redemption), personal accident, kidnap and ransom, malicious product tamper, extortion, product recall and intellectual property insurances.
- Aviation insurance covers physical damage, aviation liabilities, loss of license (pilot), loss of use (of an aircarft) and airport oeprators insurances.
- Reinsurance is a risk transfer from insurer to another insurer and there are many benefits for the insurer, such as increased capacity (because all insurers have a limit on how much business they write), smoothing peaks and troughs, allowing the insurer to try new classes of business, accessing other geographical locations and accessing and protecting a portfolio (class of business).
