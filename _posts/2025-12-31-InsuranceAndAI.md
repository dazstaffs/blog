On a recent 4 hour flight from Tenerife to London, I had time to reflect on the London Market Insurance exams that I passed this year and how AI intersects with Insurance as a whole. In this blog entry and while fully acknowledging that this is a complex discussion point, I shall try to explain what AI is at a high level, what AI can do and then give real examples of how this applies to insurance, while not boring any of my readers.

## What is AI?

 At the highest level, AI is simply a set of technologies that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. But here's the important distinction: AI isn't about creating consciousness. It's about creating capability. The "intelligence" comes from algorithms that improve through exposure to data, learning from examples rather than following rigid, pre-programmed instructions.

## How does AI actually work?

 At a technical level, most modern AI (specifically "machine learning") works through a process called training. Imagine teaching a child what a cat is by showing them hundreds of cat pictures. AI learns similarly:
- Data In: The system is fed massive amounts of data (cat images, in our example)
- Pattern Detection: It identifies patterns and features (pointy ears, whiskers, fur texture)
- Model Creation: It builds a mathematical model based on these patterns
- Testing & Refinement: The model is tested and refined until it reliably identifies cats in new images it has never seen before.

## What does this mean in the business world?

From a business perspective therefore we can use AI to do the following:

- Extract information from text
- Convert text to speech
- Convert speech to text
- Predict values
- Generate recommendations
- Discover structure
- Find unusual occurences
- Categorise by one or more categories
- Classify images
- Process large amounts of data 24/7
- Communicate with customers 24/7

## How AI is being used in insurance?

Let's break this question down in the various departments in insurance.

### Claims

AI has transformed the claims department, the critical "store-front" of the insurance journey into a seamless, 24/7 empathetic operation. Because this is the moment where customers decide their future loyalty, insurers are using AI voice agents to provide instant support 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Built on scalable cloud technology, these agents handle high volumes of basic inquiries without the frustration of call queues, ensuring that policyholders feel heard and supported in their time of need while allowing human handlers to focus on the most sensitive, high-value cases.

The integration of advanced image recognition further accelerates this process by assisting loss adjusters in virtually assessing the cause and extent of damages. By analyzing photos and videos in real-time, AI ensures that payouts are both fair and accurate, acting as a neutral representative to validate claims. 

Beyond the initial settlement, AI optimizes the subrogation process by scanning legal databases and past litigation to identify third-party liabilities and predict potential court awards. This end-to-end automation not only keeps costs down for the insurer but significantly enhances the customer experience by delivering a faster, more transparent path to recovery.

### Underwriting

In Underwriting, AI and machine learning (ML) systems, especially those using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), can automatically extract and validate data from a vast array of sources and unstructured documents, such as medical records, financial statements, property photos, and public records. This eliminates time-consuming manual data entry, reducing errors and processing times from days or weeks to minutes for standard policies.

AI algorithms can analyse massive datasets and identify patterns and correlations that human underwriters might miss, leading to more accurate risk modeling. This includes using alternative data sources like real-time data from IoT devices (wearables, vehicle telematics, smart home sensors) and satellite imagery for property assessments, which provides a more holistic view of an applicant's risk profile.

By automating data analysis and risk scoring, AI significantly accelerates the underwriting process. This speed allows insurers to provide instant quotes and issue policies much faster, which improves customer satisfaction and helps attract new business.

AI excels at detecting inconsistencies and anomalies in application data and claims patterns that may indicate fraud or misrepresentation. Flagging these issues early in the underwriting process helps insurers mitigate losses and reduce exposure to high-risk policies.

### Modelling

AI has transformed insurance underwriting by shifting the industry from reactive historical analysis to proactive, real-time risk management. By integrating high-resolution satellite imagery and climate simulations directly into catastrophe (Cat) modeling, AI provides a more granular understanding of how specific hazards interact with individual property vulnerabilities. This allows insurers to calculate the Probable Maximum Loss (PML) with much greater confidence, ensuring they hold sufficient capital for extreme events without overpricing policies. These models move beyond static spreadsheets, enabling "dynamic underwriting" where risk profiles are updated continuously as new environmental data emerges.

Furthermore, AI enhances the rigor of Realistic Disaster Scenarios (RDS) by generating sophisticated synthetic simulations of major catastrophes, such as unprecedented flood patterns or seismic shifts. This helps underwriters identify hidden correlations and "tail risks" that traditional models might miss. 

### Reserving

AI has moved beyond simple automation to fundamentally redefine the actuarial function of reserving. By utilizing machine learning algorithms like gradient boosting and neural networks, insurers are now able to calculate reserving amounts and allocate capacity by Line of Business (LOB) with far greater precision. Unlike traditional "chain-ladder" methods that rely heavily on historical averages, AI identifies non-linear patterns across thousands of data points—including real-time claims development and structural market shifts allowing for more accurate, segment-specific reserve setting. 

A critical breakthrough is in the management of Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims. AI-powered models excel at "quantifying uncertainty" by analyzing unstructured data from claim notes and social signals to flag adverse trends earlier than manual reviews. This proactive approach reduces the risk of "reserve surprises" and ensures that insurers maintain the correct capital capacity to remain solvent. By integrating these predictive insights into the core of their operations, insurers can optimize their capital deployment across different portfolios, ensuring they have the liquidity to meet future obligations while remaining competitive in a volatile global market.

### Broking

AI is fundamentally reshaped the brokering landscape, enabling brokers to act as sophisticated strategic advisors rather than mere intermediaries. By leveraging advanced data scraping and natural language processing, brokers can now present risks to underwriters with unparalleled clarity, providing "neatly packaged" submissions that highlight salient points and summarize complex financial data. This granular level of insight allows brokers to advocate for the best terms and conditions for the insured, moving away from one-size-fits-all coverage to hyper-personalized policies that precisely match a client's specific behavioral and risk profile. 

Furthermore, AI-driven specialised tools now assist in creating the best T&Cs for Terms of Business Agreements (TOBAs), ensuring these critical contracts are optimized for transparency and compliance while clearly defining responsibilities between brokers and providers. Brokers also use AI to interact more effectively with rating agencies, utilizing predictive analytics to demonstrate the long-term stability and strength of their portfolios. By marrying computational power with human judgment, brokers in 2025 are not only improving operational efficiency but are also ensuring their clients receive fairer pricing and more robust protection in an increasingly volatile market.

### Reinsurance

AI has fundamentally reshaped the reinsurance landscape by introducing "algorithmic syndication" to the placement process. By analyzing massive historical datasets, AI helps brokers and cedants identify the most effective slip leader for a specific Line of Business (LOB) based on their past technical expertise, claims-settlement reputation, and pricing stability. Once a leader is selected, AI-driven negotiation tools assist them in setting the best terms and conditions that balance a competitive edge for the insured with sustainable margins for the following market. This creates a more transparent and efficient syndication process, ensuring all parties are aligned on the risk from the outset.

Beyond placement, AI acts as a digital backbone for the entire policy lifecycle, streamlining the changes and claims processes. Through automated straight-through processing, AI can instantly validate and approve routine policy endorsements and standard claims, ensuring that coverage remains accurate and payments are disbursed without manual friction. By integrating these predictive insights and automated workflows, reinsurers can manage complex, multi-layered placements with unprecedented speed, reducing administrative costs and providing a more responsive service to the primary market.

### Regulatory

AI serves as the critical "compliance engine" that allows insurers to navigate an increasingly complex global legal landscape. To meet the rigorous demands of GDPR, AI-driven governance tools automate data anonymisation and "right to be forgotten" protocols, ensuring that the personal data used in underwriting is handled with strict privacy. 

Simultaneously, AI provides real-time screening for sanctions and financial crime, instantly cross-referencing global watchlists against policyholders and ultimate beneficial owners to prevent illegal transactions before they occur. By embedding these controls directly into the digital workflow, insurers can monitor risks continuously rather than relying on periodic manual audits.

Furthermore, AI is instrumental in identifying and mitigating potential conflicts of interest, such as when a broker’s incentives might misalign with the insured's best interests, by flagging anomalous patterns in placement and commission structures. This technological oversight ensures that firms remain in strict alignment with the Insurance Act 2015, particularly regarding the "duty of fair presentation" and the transparency of policy terms. By automating the trail of documentation and decision-making, AI provides a robust audit trail that satisfies laws and regulatory bodies, demonstrating that every policy issued is both compliant and ethically grounded in a rapidly evolving market.

## Final Thoughts

The journey of AI in insurance is no longer one of speculative potential but of concrete integration. As we've seen, from the first point of contact in claims to the complex capital decisions in reinsurance, artificial intelligence is becoming the indispensable co-pilot of the modern industry. It is not replacing human expertise but augmenting it—freeing professionals from repetitive data tasks to focus on empathy, complex judgment, and strategic innovation.

The true power of AI lies in this synthesis: the relentless, pattern-finding capacity of machines combined with the nuanced understanding and ethical oversight of human experts. For insurers, this means unprecedented efficiency, accuracy, and resilience. For brokers, it means the ability to offer truly bespoke advocacy. And most importantly, for policyholders, it translates to faster, fairer, and more transparent service when they need it most.

The transition is complex, demanding careful attention to data quality, model governance, and regulatory compliance. Yet, the direction is clear. The insurers and brokers who thrive will be those who lean into this partnership, using AI not just to automate the past, but to intelligently underwrite the future.
