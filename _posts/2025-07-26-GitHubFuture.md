# Why GitHub is Better Than Azure DevOps for Secure Code Management

When it comes to modern DevOps platforms, **GitHub** stands out as a superior choice compared to **Azure DevOps**—especially for teams focused on **security, dependency management, and automated code analysis**. With features like **CodeQL, Dependabot, and license scanning**, GitHub provides a more robust and integrated experience for keeping your code secure.

Let’s break down why GitHub excels in these areas.

---

## 1. CodeQL: Advanced Static Code Analysis

CodeQL is GitHub’s powerful semantic code analysis engine that helps identify vulnerabilities before they reach production. Unlike Azure DevOps, which relies on third-party extensions for deep code scanning, GitHub provides CodeQL natively for free on public repositories and as part of GitHub Advanced Security for private ones.

### How CodeQL Works

- Scans code for security flaws (SQLi, XSS, hardcoded secrets, etc.)
- Runs automatically on every push or PR
- Provides detailed findings with remediation guidance

Azure DevOps requires manual setup of security scanning tools like SonarQube or Checkmarx, which often involve additional licensing costs and configuration overhead.

---

## 2. Dependabot: Automated Dependency Updates & Security Fixes

**Dependabot** is a game-changer for dependency management. It automatically:

- Checks for outdated dependencies
- Opens pull requests to update them
- Alerts you about known vulnerabilities

Azure DevOps lacks a built-in equivalent—you’d need external tools like WhiteSource or Renovate, which require additional setup and licensing.

---

## 3. License Scanning: Avoid Risky Dependencies

GitHub automatically scans dependencies for license compliance issues, warning you if a package has restrictive (e.g., GPL) or non-compliant licenses.

Azure DevOps doesn’t offer native license scanning—you’d need third-party solutions, adding complexity.

## Final Thoughts

GitHub’s Security-First Approach Wins

| Feature                  | GitHub (Native)               | Azure DevOps (Requires Extensions) |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Static Code Analysis** | ✅ CodeQL (built-in)          | ❌ Needs SonarQube/Checkmarx       |
| **Dependency Updates**   | ✅ Dependabot (automatic PRs) | ❌ Requires Renovate/WhiteSource   |
| **License Scanning**     | ✅ Built-in                   | ❌ Manual tools needed             |

GitHub’s seamless integration of security tools makes it the better choice for teams that prioritize secure, maintainable, and compliant code\*\*. Enable GitHub Advanced Security today and see the difference!
