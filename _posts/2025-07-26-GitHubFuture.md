When it comes to modern DevOps platforms, GitHub stands out as a superior choice compared to Azure DevOps—especially for teams focused on security, dependency management, and automated code analysis. With features like CodeQL, Dependabot, and license scanning, GitHub provides a more robust and integrated experience for keeping your code secure.

Let’s break down why GitHub excels in these areas.

## 1. **CodeQL: Advanced Static Code Analysis**

CodeQL is GitHub’s powerful semantic code analysis engine that helps identify vulnerabilities before they reach production. Unlike Azure DevOps, which relies on third-party extensions for deep code scanning, GitHub provides CodeQL natively for free on public repositories and as part of GitHub Advanced Security for private ones. CodeQL:

- Scans code for security flaws (SQLi, XSS, hardcoded secrets, etc.)
- Runs automatically on every push or Pull Request
- Provides detailed findings with remediation guidance
- GitHub Copilot can also attempt to fix the problem for you with code suggestions

Let's take a look at CodeQL in action. In this screenshot we can see CodeQL has found 51 code issues:

If we drill down into one of the issues found, we see an explanation of the vulnerability at the bottom right and an offer to fix the problem for us, using co-pilot's AI:

Clicking generate fix, co-pilot has generated a fix for us and we just need to commit it:

## 2. **Dependabot: Automated Dependency Updates & Security Fixes**

Dependabot is a game-changer for dependency management. It automatically:

- Checks for outdated dependencies
- Opens pull requests to update them
- Alerts you about known vulnerabilities

Let's see some of the dependency vulnerabilities that it has found. Here it is pointing out problems with Mongoose being out of date:

## 3. **Secret Scanning**

GitHub automatically scans your code for secrets such as usernames and password, APIs keys, etc, that should be stored in a more secure place. Luckily for me, no secrets have been found:

## What about Azure DevOps?

The big question on your mind then, is can't Azure DevOps (ADO) do these things too?!?! Well yes it can, but at more expense and not in the same security-first way that GitHub can.

Take static code analysis as an example. Azure DevOps will allow you to enable advanced security which can also include CodeQL, but you have to setup Azure billing to do this as there's a steeper cost involved or you need to buy licenses for tools like SonarQube or Checkmarx. Then there's dependency updates which will require licenses for tools such as Snyk. And finally, secret scanning requires you to link ADO to GibHub's secret scanning - it doesn't come out of the box with ADO.

## Final Thoughts

GitHub’s Security-First Approach Wins. GitHub’s seamless integration of security tools makes it the better choice for teams that prioritize secure, maintainable, and compliant code. Enable GitHub Advanced Security today to see the difference and to save money on buying additional licenses for Azure DevOps.
